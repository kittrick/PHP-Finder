IMPORTANT
This system is currently experimental and SHOULD NOT BE INSTALLED ON A LIVE SERVER.
File browsers give file access, which makes your site incredibly insecure.
At the moment no authorization, login, or authentication system has been
Implemented. I recommend developing only on a local host. Use at your own risk.

That said, please feel free to use any part of this code or it's components.
